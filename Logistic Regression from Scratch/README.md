## Overview
The purpose of this mini project is to brush up on my Machine Learning skills before diving into some Deep Learning. 
Using the Titanic.csv data set which can be found in the data folder I performed **Logistic Regression** from **scratch**.
It was a tedious process, but coding ML algorithms from scratch is a great way to strengthen your understanding of the algorithm. 
Luckily, I was able to use **Python**. I have done this project in C++ and it was even more tedious. 

## Technologies Used
For this project used **Google Collab**, **Python**, and the **Pandas**, **Numpy**, and **Seaborn** libraries.
