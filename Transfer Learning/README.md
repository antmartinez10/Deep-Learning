## Overview
In this project I learnt the fundamentals of **Transfer learning**. Transfer learning is a process where you take an existing trained model, and extend it to do additional work. This involves leaving the bulk of the model unchanged, while adding and retraining the final layers, in order to get a different set of possible outputs. Using the **Flowers** dataset from TensorFlow Datasets I used transfer learning and built a **Keras Sequential model** to accurately predict flower classification from images. **I ended up getting an accuracy of 99%**. This was much better than the **sequential model** that I built without using transfer learning which only had an **accuracy of ~76%.**
